** ScaffoldingReadme **

Support for ASP.NET Core Identity was added to your project
- The code for adding Identity to your project was generated under Areas/Identity.

Configuration of the Identity related services can be found in the
 Areas/Identity/IdentityHostingStartup.cs file.


The generated UI requires support for static files. To add static files to your app:
1. Call app.UseStaticFiles() from your Configure method

To use ASP.NET Core Identity you also need to enable authentication.
To authentication to your app:
1. Call app.UseAuthentication() from your Configure method (after static files)

The generated UI requires MVC. To add MVC to your app:
1. Call services.AddMvc() from your ConfigureServices method
2. Call app.UseMvc() from your Configure method (after authentication)

Apps that use ASP.NET Core Identity should also use HTTPS. To enable HTTPS
 see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054.
